# What is the purpose and scope of the data analysis?
For Project 1, Uber Project participants (from here on out referred as UB1) Kevin Lindstam, Duy Nghiem, Justin Trout and Yvonne Duncan worked as a group to find and analyze a dataset of our choosing. UB1 used kaggle.com to find a dataset.
# What are the sources and formats of the data files?
UB1 chose the following dataset - [Uber Data Analysis] (https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhanupratapbiswas/uber-data-analysis-project)
The dataset provided on kaggle: UberDataset.csv (87.66 kb)
# How are the data files organized and named?
All files were downloaded independently by each group member to local workstations and then uploaded to github for group collaboration. UB1 also used zoom, google.docs, google.colabs, Slack and personal email to collaborate throughout the project.
# What are the programs used for data processing and analysis?
UB1 used jupyter notebook and google colaboratory to process data sets and imported the following within each: scipy.stats, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, requests, seaborn, and os
# What are the assumptions, limitations, or caveats of the data analysis?
Assumptions:
1. Data set used was exclusively for 2016. Based on the limited number of lines of data (1155) that not all uber rides in 2016 were presented.
